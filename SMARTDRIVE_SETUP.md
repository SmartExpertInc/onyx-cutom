# Smart Drive Setup Guide

## Overview
Smart Drive integrates Nextcloud file storage with Onyx, allowing users to sync files automatically and create per-user connectors for personal data sources.

## Environment Variables

Add these environment variables to your `.env` file in `deployment/docker_compose/.env`:

### Required for Smart Drive
```bash
# Nextcloud Integration (UPDATED - uses shared account approach)
NEXTCLOUD_USERNAME=smart_drive_user
NEXTCLOUD_PASSWORD=your_nextcloud_shared_account_password

# Smart Drive Database (if not already set)
CUSTOM_PROJECTS_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://custom_user:custom_password@custom_projects_db:5432/custom_projects_db

# Existing Required Variables
ONYX_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:password@relational_db:5432/onyx_db
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

### For Nginx Routing
```bash
# Nextcloud upstream for proxy (hostname:port only)
NEXTCLOUD_UPSTREAM_HOST=nc1.contentbuilder.ai:8080
```

## Database Tables

The following tables are automatically created on startup:

1. **`smartdrive_accounts`** - Per-user SmartDrive linkage and sync state
2. **`smartdrive_imports`** - Maps SmartDrive files to imported Onyx documents  
3. **`user_connectors`** - Per-user connector configurations

## Features

### ✅ Implemented
- **Smart Drive Tab**: Browse and sync files from Nextcloud
- **File Listing**: WebDAV integration to list actual Nextcloud files  
- **File Import**: Downloads from Nextcloud and uploads to Onyx
- **Sync Tracking**: Tracks imported files and prevents duplicates
- **Native Onyx Connectors**: Users create private connectors using Onyx's existing system
- **OAuth Support**: Full OAuth integration via Onyx's connector forms
- **HTTPS Support**: Proper mixed content handling

### 🔧 Current Limitations
- Uses basic auth for Nextcloud (should use OAuth/app passwords in production)
- No real-time webhook support (manual sync required)
- Directory uploads not implemented

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Extension context invalidated" when creating connectors
- This is a browser extension conflict, not our code
- The form data is being sent correctly to the backend
- Try disabling browser extensions or use incognito mode

### Issue: Files don't appear after sync (401 Unauthorized)
- ✅ **Fixed**: Now uses shared Nextcloud account approach
- Verify `NEXTCLOUD_USERNAME` and `NEXTCLOUD_PASSWORD` are correct for the shared account
- Each Onyx user gets their own folder within the shared Nextcloud account (e.g., `/smart_drive_user/{onyx_user_id}/`)
- Check that the shared Nextcloud account has proper permissions
- Look for import errors in backend logs

### Issue: Mixed content HTTPS/HTTP errors  
- ✅ **Fixed**: iframe now uses same protocol as parent page

### Issue: Custom connector endpoints returning 410 errors
- ✅ **Fixed**: Now using Onyx's native connector system with `AccessType.PRIVATE`
- Users are redirected to proper Onyx connector creation and management pages
- All OAuth flows and connector configurations work exactly like admin connectors

### Issue: Connectors created through Smart Drive are not private
- ✅ **Fixed**: Modified Onyx's connector creation endpoints to force `AccessType.PRIVATE`
- Smart Drive connector links include `smart_drive=true` parameter
- Backend detects this parameter and automatically sets access_type to PRIVATE
- Connectors are now truly private and only visible to the user who created them

## Next Steps for Production

1. **Secure Authentication**: Replace basic auth with Nextcloud OAuth or app passwords
2. **Webhook Integration**: Implement real-time sync via Nextcloud webhooks
3. **Encrypted Credentials**: Store user Nextcloud credentials encrypted
4. **Directory Support**: Allow uploading/syncing entire folders
5. **Error Handling**: Better user feedback for sync failures

## API Endpoints

### Smart Drive
- `POST /api/custom-projects-backend/smartdrive/session` - Initialize SmartDrive session
- `GET /api/custom-projects-backend/smartdrive/list` - List files from Nextcloud
- `POST /api/custom-projects-backend/smartdrive/import-new` - Sync new/updated files

### User Connectors (Using Onyx's Native System)
- **Create**: `/admin/connectors/{source}?access_type=private` - Onyx's connector creation forms with OAuth
- **List**: `/api/manage/admin/connector` - Onyx's connector API (filter for private connectors)  
- **Manage**: `/admin/connector/{id}` - Onyx's connector management UI
- **Sync**: `/api/manage/admin/connector/{id}/index` - Onyx's connector sync API

*Previous custom endpoints at `/api/custom-projects-backend/smartdrive/connectors/` are deprecated and return HTTP 410 with redirect information.*
