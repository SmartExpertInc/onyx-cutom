1. **Paragraph-first approach**: Generate flowing text, not just lists
2. **Bloom's Taxonomy enforcement**: Require progression through cognitive levels
3. **Worked example requirement**: Minimum 2-3 complete scenarios with analysis
4. **Mixed content blocks**: Mandate paragraphs (60%), lists (20%), examples (10%), recommendations (10%)
5. **Word count targets**: Minimum 4,000 words for "long" educational content
