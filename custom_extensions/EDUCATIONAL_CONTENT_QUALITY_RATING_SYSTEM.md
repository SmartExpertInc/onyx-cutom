## Recommendation for Improvement

The content needs transformation from a **fact sheet** into a **learning document** with:
1. Opening paragraphs for context and engagement
2. Mixed content blocks (paragraphs + lists + recommendations + alerts)
3. Worked examples with complete reasoning
4. Narrative flow that builds understanding progressively
5. Visual variety to maintain engagement
