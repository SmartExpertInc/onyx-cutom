**Problems**:
- 🔴 13 level 2 headers (way too many!)
- 🔴 Each section has only 50-100 words
- 🔴 Everything looks equally important (no hierarchy)
- 🔴 Content feels like a disconnected list
- 🔴 Hard to see the big picture
- 🔴 Looks unprofessional and choppy
- 🔴 No logical grouping of related concepts

**User Experience**: *"This looks weird... why are there so many big headers?"*

## 📊 INTRODUCTION TO PRICING STRATEGY          ← Level 2 (MAJOR SECTION)
Choosing the right pricing strategy is crucial for maximizing 
revenue and profit while maintaining customer satisfaction. It 
involves understanding different pricing models, the value provided 
to customers, and how price can be used as a tool to achieve 
business goals.

This guide explores the foundations of pricing strategy, incorporating 
Bloom's Taxonomy to ensure a comprehensive learning experience. You'll 
learn not just WHAT different pricing models are, but WHY they work, 
HOW to apply them, and WHEN to choose one over another.

## 🎯 CORE PRICING MODELS                       ← Level 2 (MAJOR SECTION)
Understanding the fundamental pricing models is the foundation of 
strategic pricing decisions. Each model has distinct advantages and 
use cases...

[150 words introducing the three models]

### Cost-Plus Pricing                            ← Level 3 (subsection)
Cost-Plus Pricing involves adding a markup to the cost of goods to 
ensure a profit. While straightforward, it may not always consider 
customer willingness to pay or market conditions.

**When to Use**: This approach works best when costs are predictable 
and stable, competition is limited, and customers accept cost-based 
pricing norms. For example, in manufacturing industries where material 
costs fluctuate, cost-plus ensures margins remain protected regardless 
of input price changes.

**Key Limitation**: It ignores value perception—you might leave money 
on the table if customers would pay more, or price yourself out if they 
perceive less value than your cost-plus price suggests.

### Value-Based Pricing                          ← Level 3 (subsection)
Value-Based Pricing is set based on the perceived value to the customer 
rather than the cost of the product. It requires a deep understanding 
of customer needs and value perceptions.

**When to Use**: Choose value-based pricing when your product has clear 
differentiation, you can measure customer ROI, and you have premium 
positioning. SaaS companies often use this model—charging based on the 
value delivered (time saved, revenue generated) rather than development 
cost.

**Key Challenge**: Requires extensive customer research to understand 
value perception. You need data on willingness-to-pay, competitor 
offerings, and customer ROI calculations.

### Competition-Based Pricing                    ← Level 3 (subsection)
Competition-Based Pricing sets prices based on what competitors charge. 
This approach is common in commoditized markets where differentiation 
is difficult...

### Elasticity of Demand Framework               ← Level 3 (subsection)
Elasticity of Demand measures how demand changes with price. A product 
is 'elastic' if demand significantly decreases with a price increase...

**How to Apply**:
1. Calculate price elasticity: % change in quantity / % change in price
2. If elasticity > 1: Lower prices to increase revenue
3. If elasticity < 1: You can raise prices without losing much volume

## The Rules We Implemented

### Level 2 Headers (Major Sections)
- **Count**: 4-6 total per document
- **Content**: 300-500+ words each
- **Purpose**: Organize the entire document
- **Examples**: Introduction, Core Concepts, Application, Common Mistakes, Skill Practice, Conclusion
- **Visual**: Large emoji icon + ALL CAPS or Title Case

### Level 3 Headers (Subsections)
- **Count**: 2-5 per level 2 section
- **Content**: 150-300 words each
- **Purpose**: Break down content within major sections
- **Examples**: Specific pricing models, specific steps, specific mistakes
- **Visual**: Title Case, slightly smaller than level 2

### Content Grouping Logic
```
Instead of:
  ## Cost-Plus Pricing (level 2)
  ## Value-Based Pricing (level 2)
  ## Competition-Based Pricing (level 2)

Use:
  ## Core Pricing Models (level 2)
    ### Cost-Plus Pricing (level 3)
    ### Value-Based Pricing (level 3)
    ### Competition-Based Pricing (level 3)
```
