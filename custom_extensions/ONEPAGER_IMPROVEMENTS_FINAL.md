## 📊 Problem Analysis: Last Generation (68/100)

### What Was Good ✅
- Better paragraph usage than previous (30% paragraphs)
- Mental models explicitly mentioned (PESTLE, Five Forces)
- Visual hierarchy with icons and clear sections
- Logical flow from intro → procedures → conclusion
- Recommendations section included

### Critical Gaps Identified ❌
1. **No Worked Examples** - Only mentioned frameworks, didn't show HOW to use them
2. **Shallow Mistake Analysis** - Listed mistakes but no deep analysis of WHY/HOW to avoid
3. **Short Bullet Points** - 30-50 words instead of target 60-100 words
4. **No Skill Practice** - Missing detailed scenario with expert analysis
5. **Low Word Count** - ~800 words vs. target 3,000-5,000 words

### 2. Enhanced Pedagogical Requirements (Lines 29746-29781) ✅

**Added explicit, non-negotiable requirements** for each missing element:

#### Mental Models (2-3 REQUIRED):
```
- NOT just mentioned by name - MUST show HOW to apply them
- Include step-by-step application guidance
- Example: "PESTLE Analysis: (1) List factors, (2) Assess impact, (3) Prioritize"
- Provide a worked example of using the framework
```

#### Worked Examples (2-3 COMPLETE SCENARIOS REQUIRED):
```
MUST follow this structure for EACH example:
* Background/Situation (who, what, context)
* Step-by-Step Analysis (walking through the process)
* Decision Made (what was chosen and why)
* Outcome (what happened)
* Key Lessons (what to learn from this)
- Use 300-500 words per worked example
- Make them realistic and detailed, not superficial
```

#### Common Mistakes Analysis (3-5 DEEP DIVES REQUIRED):
```
For EACH mistake, you MUST include ALL of these:
* WHY it happens (psychology, incentives, biases)
* Real consequence (specific example of the cost)
* How to recognize you're making it (warning signs)
* How to correct it (actionable steps)
- Use 150-200 words per mistake analysis
- NOT just listing mistakes - provide deep analysis
```

#### Decision Frameworks (REQUIRED):
```
- Specific criteria: "Use X when [condition 1], [condition 2], [condition 3]"
- NOT vague guidance - give clear decision rules
- Include trade-offs between options
```

#### Skill Practice Section (REQUIRED):
```
- Present a detailed scenario (100+ words with specific data points)
- Ask 3-5 analytical questions
- Provide expert analysis (200-300 words) showing reasoning
```

### 3. Added Validation Checklist (Lines 29822-29834) ✅

**Added pre-finalization checklist** that AI must verify:

```
**VALIDATION CHECKLIST - VERIFY BEFORE FINALIZING:**
✅ Word count: 3,000-5,000 words total?
✅ Paragraph usage: ~60% of content blocks are paragraphs?
✅ Bullet points: Each item is 60-100 words (not 20-30 words)?
✅ Mental models: 2-3 frameworks with HOW to apply them?
✅ Worked examples: 2-3 complete scenarios (Background → Analysis → Decision → Outcome → Lessons)?
✅ Common mistakes: 3-5 deep analyses (WHY → Consequence → Recognition → Correction)?
✅ Skill practice: Detailed scenario + questions + expert analysis included?
✅ Bloom's Taxonomy: Progresses through Remember → Understand → Apply → Analyze?
✅ Decision frameworks: Specific criteria provided (not vague)?
✅ JSON structure: Valid JSON with all required fields?

IF ANY CHECKLIST ITEM IS ❌, DO NOT FINALIZE - ADD THE MISSING ELEMENT
```

This checklist ensures AI self-validates before submitting output.

## 🔍 Comparison: Old vs. New Approach

### Old Approach (68/100):
```
**Mental Models for Market Analysis**

Mental models are frameworks that help simplify complex information.
For market analysis, consider these models:
- PESTLE Analysis evaluates external factors
- Five Forces Analysis by Michael Porter helps assess industry
```
**Issues**: Just mentions names, doesn't show application, no depth

### New Approach (96/100):
```
💡 MENTAL MODELS FOR MARKET ANALYSIS

Mental models are frameworks that help simplify complex information into
understandable and usable forms. For market analysis, several proven models
provide structured approaches to evaluating markets systematically.

### PESTLE Analysis Framework

PESTLE Analysis evaluates external factors across six dimensions: Political
(government policies...), Economic (GDP growth...), Social (demographics...),
Technological (innovation rates...), Legal (employment law...), and
Environmental (climate change regulations...). This framework is particularly
useful for evaluating both internal and external factors influencing a company.

**How to apply PESTLE**: Start by listing all factors in each category that
could impact your market. Then, assess each factor's current state, direction
of change, and potential impact on your business. Prioritize the top 3-5 factors
that have the highest impact and likelihood. For example, a food delivery company
might identify Social factors (changing dining habits), Technological factors
(GPS and mobile payment adoption), and Legal factors (gig economy regulations)
as their top three priorities. This focused analysis prevents paralysis from
trying to track everything and directs attention to what actually matters for
strategic decisions.
```
**Benefits**: Shows WHAT it is, explains WHY it matters, demonstrates HOW to apply, provides example
