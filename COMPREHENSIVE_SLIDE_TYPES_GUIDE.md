## How to Request Specific Slide Types

### Method 1: Direct Template Requests
Users can explicitly request specific templates:
- "Use bullet-points for the key benefits"
- "Create a big-numbers slide for the statistics"
- "Show a pyramid hierarchy for the concepts"

### Method 2: Content Type Requests
Users can request content types that map to specific templates:
- "Show bullet points" → `bullet-points`
- "Compare the approaches" → `two-column`
- "Display statistics" → `big-numbers`
- "Create a timeline" → `timeline`

### Method 3: Descriptive Requests
Users can describe what they want, and the AI will select the appropriate template:
- "Show the main benefits in a grid" → `four-box-grid`
- "Present challenges and solutions" → `challenges-solutions`
- "Create a visual demonstration" → `big-image-top`

## Priority Rules

1. **User Intent Priority**: When users explicitly request specific content types, their request takes precedence over template restrictions
2. **Template Diversity**: The system ensures variety by avoiding consecutive use of the same template
3. **Educational Quality**: All templates maintain high educational standards while matching user requests
4. **Flexibility**: The system adapts to user preferences while maintaining presentation quality
